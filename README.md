# CodeQuiz

A simple quiz game about coding built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), vanilla JS and local storage.
This was a much more complicated project than the previous ones for the course and included semi-persistent
data via local storage. I feel my code could probably use better organization and perhaps also be refactored
to be a bit more concise, but compromises have to be made with a due date. Everything works how it should so that
is a victory!

Additional features/improvents which could be cool include:

- Ability to delete individual high scores
- Confirmation for deleting all high scores.
- Highscore table sorting
- Random question order
- Random answer order for each question
- Better card design for questions
- Ability to select number of questions at start
